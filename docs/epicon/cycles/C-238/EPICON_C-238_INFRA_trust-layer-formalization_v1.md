justification:
  VALUES INVOKED: integrity, accountability, transparency
  REASONING: |
    The Mobius trust layer needed to move from design documents to
    production-grade artifacts. This cycle formalized governance
    documents, created machine-readable schemas for verification
    workflows, and tested the full ECHO-ZEUS-HERMES agent loop
    against a real-time geopolitical event as a verification challenge.
  ANCHORS:
    - Governance documents existed as drafts since C-200
    - No machine-readable schema for verification workflows existed
    - The ECHO-ZEUS-HERMES loop had never been tested against a live event
  BOUNDARIES:
    - Applies to governance layer and verification pipeline only
    - Does not affect application code or service infrastructure
  COUNTERFACTUAL:
    - If governance schemas fail validation in CI, revert to draft status
    - If real-time verification challenge produces false confidence, document failure mode
```

## Context

Prior to C-238, the Mobius trust layer existed as conceptual documents and partial implementations. The Three Covenants (Integrity, Ecology, Custodianship), the DVA governance tiers, and the agent roles were defined but not operationalized in a way that could be tested against real-world events.

## What Changed

1. **Production governance documents** — formalized and committed to the monorepo with machine-readable frontmatter
2. **Verification schemas** — JSON schemas for the ECHO-ZEUS-HERMES verification pipeline, enabling automated validation
3. **Live verification challenge** — a real-time geopolitical event was used as a test case for the full agent loop:
   - ECHO captured the initial signal from open-source intelligence feeds
   - ZEUS cross-referenced against multiple source chains and assigned confidence tiers
   - HERMES routed the verified signal through the appropriate governance channels
4. **EPICON ledger record** — the verification challenge itself was recorded as a live EPICON entry, creating a self-referential audit trail

## Impact

- Moved the trust layer from design to testable infrastructure
- Demonstrated that the agent verification loop could process real events
- Established the pattern for all future real-time verification workflows
- Created the first production EPICON entry tied to an external event

## Integrity Notes

- **MII impact:** Positive — formalized governance increases system integrity
- **GI impact:** +0.02 — trust layer now has auditable, machine-readable artifacts
- **Risk:** Low — documentation and schema changes only
